A monitoring companion for Nomad periodic [jobs](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/periodic.html) that alerts if periodic isn't
running at the expected interval.

The deadman-check has 2 modes:

1. Run with the Nomad periodic job as an additional [task](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/task.html) to update a key in Consul with current EPOCH time.

2. Run as a separate process that will monitor the Consul key's EPOCH
time value and alert if that value fails to meet a time 'freshness' threshold that
is expected for that job.


### Requirements
* [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) instance
* Alerting requires a SLACK_API_TOKEN environment variable to be set (use [Slack Bot integration](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot))

## Example Usage

Let's say I have a Nomad periodic job that is set to run every 10 minutes. The Nomad configuration looks like this:

```hcl
job "SilverBulletPeriodic" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "batch"

  periodic {
    cron             = "*/10 * * * * *"
    prohibit_overlap = true
  }

  group "utility" {
    task "SilverBulletPeriodicProcess" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image    = "silverbullet:build_1"
        work_dir = "/utility/silverbullet"
        command  = "blaster"
      }
      resources {
        cpu = 100
        memory = 500
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To monitor the SilverBulletPeriodicProcess task let's add a deadmad-check task to
run post updates to a Consul endpoint (10.0.0.1 for this example)

```hcl
job "SilverBulletPeriodic" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "batch"

  periodic {
    cron             = "*/10 * * * * *"
    prohibit_overlap = true
  }

  group "silverbullet" {
    task "SilverBulletPeriodicProcess" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image    = "silverbullet:build_1"
        work_dir = "/utility/silverbullet"
        command  = "blaster"
      }
      resources {
        cpu = 100
        memory = 500
      }
    }
    task "DeadmanSetSilverBulletPeriodicProcess" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image    = "sepulworld/deadman-check"
        command  = "key_set"
        args     = [
          "--host",
          "10.0.0.1",
          "--port",
          "8500",
          "--key",
          "deadman/SilverBulletPeriodicProcess",
          "--frequency",
          "700"]
      }
      resources {
        cpu = 100
        memory = 256
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now the key, deadman/SilverBulletPeriodicProcess, at 10.0.0.1 will be updated with
the EPOCH time for each SilverBulletPeriodic job run. If the job hangs or fails to run
we will know via the EPOCH time entry going stale.

Next we need a job that will run to monitor this key.

```hcl
job "DeadmanMonitoring" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "service"

  group "monitor" {
    task "DeadmanMonitorSilverBulletPeriodicProcess" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image    = "sepulworld/deadman-check"
        command  = "switch_monitor"
        args     = [
          "--host",
          "10.0.0.1",
          "--port",
          "8500",
          "--key",
          "deadman/SilverBulletPeriodicProcess",
          "--alert-to",
          "slackroom",
          "--daemon",
          "--daemon-sleep",
          "900"]
      }
      resources {
        cpu = 100
        memory = 256
      }
      env {
        SLACK_API_TOKEN = "YourSlackApiToken"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Monitor a Consul key that contains an EPOCH time entry. Send a Slack message if EPOCH age hits given frequency threshold

If you have multiple periodic jobs that need to be monitored then use the ```--key-path``` argument instead of ```--key```. Be sure to ```key_set``` all under the same Consul key path.

<img width="658" alt="screen shot 2017-04-23 at 11 17 29 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/538171/25324510/14d6e7f0-287b-11e7-9c0d-733d69e1cc94.png">

To monitor the above you would just use the ```--key-path``` argument instead of ```--key```

```hcl
job "DeadmanMonitoring" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "service"

  group "monitor" {
    task "DeadmanMonitorSilverBulletPeriodicProcesses" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image    = "sepulworld/deadman-check"
        command  = "switch_monitor"
        args     = [
          "--host",
          "10.0.0.1",
          "--port",
          "8500",
          "--key-path",
          "deadman/",
          "--alert-to",
          "slackroom",
          "--daemon",
          "--daemon-sleep",
          "900"]
      }
      resources {
        cpu = 100
        memory = 256
      }
      env {
        SLACK_API_TOKEN = "YourSlackApiToken"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Non-Nomad Use:

## Local system installation

execute:

    $ bundle install
    $ gem install deadman_check

## Install and run deadman-check from Docker

```
# Optional: If you don't pull explicitly, `docker run` will do it for you
$ docker pull sepulworld/deadman-check

$ alias deadman-check='\
  docker run \
    -it --rm --name=deadman-check \
    sepulworld/deadman-check'
```

(Depending on how your system is set up, you might have to add sudo in front of the above docker commands or add your user to the docker group).

If you don't do the docker pull, the first time you run deadman-check, the docker run command will automatically pull the sepulworld/deadman-check image on the Docker Hub. Subsequent runs will use a locally cached copy of the image and will not have to download anything.

## Usage via Local System Install
